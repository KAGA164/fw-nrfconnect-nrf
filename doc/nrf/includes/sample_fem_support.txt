.. note::
   Software FEM support is not present on nRF53 Series devices yet.
   For now, it also cannot be combined with multiprotocol operation.

You can add support for the nRF21540 front-end module to the sample.
See :ref:`ug_radio_fem` for more information.

To add support for the nRF21540 FEM, the devicetree must contain the description of the nRF21540 FEM.
To include this description in your application, use one of the following options, depending on your hardware:

* Build the sample for one board that contains the nRF21540 FEM, such as :ref:`nrf21540dk_nrf52840 <zephyr:nrf21540dk_nrf52840>`.
* Manually create a devicetree overlay file that describes how FEM is connected to the nRF5 SoC in your device.
  See :ref:`zephyr:set-devicetree-overlays` for different ways of adding the overlay file.
* Provide nRF21540 FEM capabilities by using a :ref:`shield <zephyr:shields>`, for example the :ref:`ug_radio_fem_nrf21540_ek` shield that is available in the |NCS|.
  In this case, build the project for a board connected to the shield you are using with an appropriate variable included in the build command.
  This variable instructs the build system to append the appropriate devicetree overlay file.
  For example, to build the sample from the command line for an nRF52833 DK with the nRF21540 EK attached, use the following command within the sample directory:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -b nrf52833dk_nrf52833 -- -DSHIELD=nrf21540_ek

To add support for other front-end modules, add the respective devicetree file entries to the board devicetree file or the devicetree overlay file.
