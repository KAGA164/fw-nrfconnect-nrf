.. note::
   Software FEM support is not present on nRF53 Series devices yet.
   For now, it also cannot be combined with multiprotocol operation.

You can add support for the nRF21540 front-end module to the sample.
See :ref:`ug_radio_fem` for more information.

To add support for the nRF21540 FEM, build the sample for a board containing nRF21540 FEM like nrf21540dk_nrf52840 or create a devicetree overlay file describing how FEM is connected to nRF5 SoC in your device.

See :ref:`zephyr:set-devicetree-overlays` for different ways of adding the overlay file.

.. note::
   If you use the nRF21540 EK, append `nrf21540_ek` shield to your build command instructing build system to append the appropriate devicetree overlay file.

For example, to build the sample from the command line for an nRF52833 DK with an attached nRF21540 EK, invoke the following command within the sample directory:

.. code-block:: console

    west build -b nrf52833dk_nrf52833 -- -DSHIELD=nrf21540_ek

To add support for other front-end modules, add the respective devicetree file entries to the board devicetree file or a devicetree overlay file.
