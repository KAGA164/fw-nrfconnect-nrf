The Skyworks SKY66114 and SKY66403 are front-end module (FEM) devices that support the 2-pin PA/LNA interface.
You can also use other Skyworks FEM devices that provide the same hardware interface.

.. note::
   The functionalities designated as ``PA`` and ``LNA`` apply to the ``ctx-gpios`` and ``crx-gpios`` pins listed below, respectively.

To use the generic FEM implementation with SKY66114, complete the following steps:

1. Add the following node in the devicetree file:

   .. code-block::

      / {
         nrf_radio_fem: name_of_fem_node {
            compatible = "skyworks,sky66114-11", "generic-fem-two-ctrl-pins";
            ctx-gpios = <&gpio0 13 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
            crx-gpios = <&gpio0 14 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
         };
      };

#. Replace the pin numbers provided for each of the required properties:

   * ``ctx-gpios`` - GPIO characteristic of the device that controls the ``CTX`` signal of SKY66114-11.
   * ``crx-gpios`` - GPIO characteristic of the device that controls the ``CRX`` signal of SKY66114-11.

   These properties correspond to the ``CTX`` and ``CRX`` pins of SKY66114-11 supported by software FEM.

   The type ``phandle-array`` is used in Zephyr's devicetree to describe GPIO signals.
   The first element ``&gpio0`` refers to the GPIO port ("port 0" is selected in the example).
   The second element is the pin number of that port.
   The last element must be ``GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH`` for SKY66114-11, but for a different FEM module you can use ``GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW``.

   Set the state of the other control pins according to the SKY66114-11 documentation.
   See the official `SKY66114-11 page`_ for more information.

Optional properties
-------------------

The following properties are optional and you can add them to the devicetree node if needed:

* Properties that control the other pins:
   * ``csd-gpios`` - GPIO characteristic of the device that controls the ``CSD`` signal of SKY66114-11.
   * ``cps-gpios`` - GPIO characteristic of the device that controls the ``CPS`` signal of SKY66114-11.
   * ``chl-gpios`` - GPIO characteristic of the device that controls the ``CHL`` signal of SKY66114-11.
   * ``ant-sel-gpios`` - GPIO characteristic of the device that controls the ``ANT_SEL`` signal of devices that support antenna diversity, for example SKY66403-11.

* Properties that control the timing of interface signals:

  * ``ctx-settle-time-us`` - Minimal time interval between asserting the ``CTX`` signal and starting the radio transmission, in microseconds.
  * ``crx-settle-time-us`` - Minimal time interval between asserting the ``CRX`` signal and starting the radio reception, in microseconds.

  The default values of these properties are appropriate for default hardware and most use cases.
  You can override them if you need additional capacitors, for example when using custom hardware.
  In such cases, add the property name under the required properties in the devicetree node and set a new custom value.

  .. note::
    These values have some constraints.
    For details, see the official documentation at the `SKY66114-11 page`_.

Use case of incomplete physical connections to the FEM module
-------------------------------------------------------------

The devicetree configuration allows you to use a minimal pin configuration.
Connect all unused pins to the fixed logic level as instructed in the official documentation.
For example ``csd-gpios`` is an optional pin that sets the device into sleep mode.
If this pin is not controlled by the driver, it must be connected to the fixed logic level.
